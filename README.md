# simple GIS demo

A simple Shiny demo with a colleague to try out some ideas for a school outreach programme. Is thus not intended as a serious application.

To run this code, you need first to install the library EuData and then type the command demo(). This should open a Shiny browser which will allow you to view and explore the data.
